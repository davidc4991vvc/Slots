Will work on getting a video of it *soon*

TODO:

Lots of stuff is hardcoded that can be cleaned up. 

Model / stats are lost when application is closed. Should save off user credits/stats.

Resource loading/saving should be refactored to be controled by a single class.

Graphics are pretty much non-existant currently.
